<h1>Blurred Lines of Popular Culture</h1>
<h2>Bojan Maric</h2>
<p>October 21, 2016</p>

<p>It is a string of symbols, specific narratives, discourses, artifacts and objects that is never to be untangled. Popular culture is a situation of constantly fluctuating interaction between various narratives, actors and practices</p>
<p>It is something that exists in the shared discourse of contemporary globalized culture, seemingly lingering outside of the reach of minds that are constantly chasing its meaning, yet almost primordially already deeply influenced by it.</p>
<p>Trying to understand what is popular culture seems to be an endeavor that can never reach its purpose.</p>
<p>There are only so many aspects one can grasp at a time, unsure if all characteristics are dwelled upon, yet certain that some will be left out. </p>

<p>. We will try to look at some of the most significant theoretical frameworks needed to only start to unravel this puzzle, followed by discourses which have emerged as the most significant ones, ever since this enigma of shared reality started encompassing our world.</p>
<p>With this in mind, we will try to juxtapose these approaches and relevant concepts with some of the most iconic examples of contemporary art practice in order to identify examples that might lead to answers.</p>
<p>Which are the main elements that will lead us on a path of understanding popular culture? Are these elements present in the practice of the public? What is active interpretation? What is the place of a contemporary artists within the realm of popular culture? What is the significance of pop culture symbols and which forms do they take? What are the most important discourses that emerged in the last five decades, which determined the significance of popular culture? How does popular culture affect our existence?</p>
<p><strong>Starting to Understand </strong>Popular CultureWhat is popular culture? A popular culture definition can be a subject of a never-ending public and academic discourse. Regarded as the accumulation of different cultural products that are consumed by the majority of a society’s population, popular culture is characterized by the mass accessibility and appeal. Coined in the 19th century, the term was traditionally associated with the taste of lower and uneducated classes as opposed to the official culture of the upper class. At the beginning and all through the first half of the 20th century, mass culture was perceived in two different, but equally demeaning ways. </p>
<p>Leftwing theoreticians saw it as something produced from the above, an attempt to passivize subordinate classes. On the other hand, conservative school of thought saw the mass culture as a vehicle of aesthetic, stylistic and even ethic degradation of (their) elite culture. Perhaps the critics didn’t understand that popular culture consumed by the masses was the inseparable companion of the emerging industrial world and that soon both approaches would be proven wrong. </p>
<p>As it became clear that the masses were not passive recipients of the products and practices from the mass culture, but quite engaged consumers and creators that shaped their own cultural world, the field of popular culture became an arena for rebellion against the interests of dominant groups and against their practices of cultural patronizing. </p>

<div class="multicol">
<p>Thus, the attempt to define popular culture necessarily included the understandings of oscillations between the dichotomy control-resistance.[1] In that moment, popular culture became intrinsically political as much as aesthetical, a property that would define it until the present day.</p>
<p>After the World War II, different innovations in mass media led to significant cultural and social changes and popular culture began to take new forms and a much wider reach. In a hardly separable flux of influences and inspiration, popular culture shaped and was shaped by everything that was brought by new technologies, new media and the emerging consumer society.</p>
<p>The meaning of popular culture began to merge with the practices of the everyday and by rejecting the cultural oppression coming from the official narratives, the realm of popular began including creators and consumers regardless of their class, gender or race. The firm division between art, lower and higher culture had blurred, and all these notions became merged into one comprehensive term “culture”, covering fields of society, politics, economy and art that have been previously regarded as separate.</p>
<p>Popular culture reflects both everyday life with all its pleasures and limitations and constitutes the public primarily as a creative audience. During the 1980s and 1990s, the new wave of audience research was employed within communications and cultural studies to explore the way meaning was negotiated and constructed.[2] It was based on the reception theory that suggested that a literal text is not passively accepted, but that the reader can construct their own meaning based on their cultural background.</p>
<p>Apart from the written language, cultural studies use the concept of text to also designate television programs, films, photographs, and anything else that communicates ideas, values and interests.</p>
<p>In this way, texts of culture studies are comprised of all the meaningful artifacts of culture. The audience analysis emphasized the diversity of responses to a given popular culture artifact through exploration of active choices, uses, and interpretations made of popular cultural texts. </p>
