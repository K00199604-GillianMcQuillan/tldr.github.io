<h1>Marilyn Minter, Raunch Culture</h1>
<h2>Gillian McQuillan</h2>
<p>21 02 2018</p>
<p>In this paper I will disucss Marilyn Minter’s art work carefully in relation to the concepts of appropriation and Raunch feminism</p>
<p>I want to apprehend her advances with her visuals and distinguish if her work is complicit reproductions of pornographic and misogynistic visuals or if her work is successful in destigmatizing gender and sexuality conventions. </p>
<p>Marilyn Minters is predominantly a painter, her fine art career has seen her delve into the realms of commercial media. This outlet is embedded in her work she systematically creates visuals inspired by mass media iconography such as pornography and fashion magazines.</p>
<p> She exhibits her work creatively through the outlets of her sourced images on billboards, TV commercials and through branding. She has stated her work to be pro sex feminism but the topic for this essay is, is she just documenting these issues and recirculating them for profit or is minter meticulously playing the system as part of a revolution concerning ethical gender politics and sexuality. </p>
<p>Power and profit will always be a subtext of art and success, but it conflicts with the idea of ethics and moralism especially if it contradicts to primitive concept of the work. Minters earlier first works are photographs of her mother she was a recluse and drug addict. </p>
<p>These images and her more recent works like ‘Quails egg’ are separated over four decades apart but the recurring exploration of repugnant glamour is a strong characteristic in her visuals. Minter has a unique approach to depictions of women and femininity she produces encapsulating imagery with the same glossy polished aesthetic, like high end fashion photography but manages to avoid hegemony in relation to beauty standards. </p>

<p>Umberto Eco describes beauty as a positive trait and compares it to something ‘good’ and ‘Other times we describe as good something that conforms to some ideal’ (Eco, On Beauty, 2004, p. 7). This theory elaborates on desires, feelings and a whole spectrum of associations, ideals are not very perceptive. beauty is a limited trait idolised and a cause of infatuation.</p>
<p>The opposition to beauty is frequently misconstrued as ugliness these subjects don’t work as binary codes. The subject of grotesque and repulsion is far more evasive which is ironic because this is the same problem when concerning sexuality, they can’t be boxed and labelled they are malleable in terms of subjectivity. </p>
<p>Minter states that ‘there are no answers when it comes to sexuality…it is very messy and very untidy’ (Johanna Burton, 2010, p. 20). Secretion is one of her main traits in her work also an unsavoury element of the grotesque it is visible in her subject as visceral secreting bodily matter, but as an aesthetic her paintings secrete life also. </p>
<p>Analysing her work, the Supremes and quails egg they were made ten years apart. Her approach of aesthetics first is evident in both works but there is a clear evolution of craft. </p>
<p>Her piece quails egg is a hyper real approach and part of when she started creating her own original imagery through photography, whereas ‘The Supremes’ was a still from pornography her aesthetic was perceptively abstract perhaps it was due to her use of found imagery. </p>
<p>When contrasting these two images together a notable difference in her approach is also subject matter. She continued working with the same theme but in ‘Quails egg’ and her later works minter uses objects as signifiers to gender, this is assumptions made by the viewer and society on associating a gender with these objects and subjects such as lipstick and jewellery</p>

<p>. In her direct subversions from pornography there is a literal directory to the gender roles as they are clear depictions of genitalia and bodily matter, the stills that she chose to paint are what create her narrative of the gender roles its portrayed in the positioning and movement in the paintings.</p>
<p>Oral gratification is a commonality between the two works it revolves around the theme of desirous tantalizing signifiers, unfulfilling and boundless obsessions. The images both depict secreting matter which is an aspect of literal and symbolic bodily matter fluid discharging the system of ingesting and ejection.</p>
<p>The body parts she incorporates are symbolic of this there are areas that deposit, but they could also be interpreted as erogenous zones. The visuals intend to be coercive yet repulsive simultaneously.</p>
<p>. This could be interpreted through morality of the themes she explores also. The abjection of body’s in society the psychological tactics of advertising and mass media promising perfection, a tyranny of selection made in obsolescence.</p>
<p>Her work ‘100 food porn’ elaborates on these concepts further, Marilyn bought advertising spots on a well, known talk show. She created a 30 second video for an upcoming exhibition. This tactic caused so much controversy and confusion that the paintings and art were almost lost in the narrative. Her commercial was a key element though, the provocative title and its commercial placement exemplified the attraction of click bait like advertisements. </p>
<p>The title 100 referenced the number of paintings in the show but also was a link to phone sex numbers. (Johanna Burton, 2010, p. 29). The fluctuating tone of the music in the commercial created and encapsulating tone. </p>

<p>It began sounding like a tense sinister anthem but broke into convulsions of slow jazz. The visuals that occurred in her painting were different types of food being handled and separated. The hand alienated any identity of gender except for the incorporation of nail polish, this was an ode to the stereotype 
of the domesticated housewife complacent sex object. </p>
<p>‘Chiaroscuro’’ was created in 1991 it came shortly after her series porn grids which was previously discussed. The development of this image however is the suspected isolated female. The image depicts female genitalia and a hand with red nail polish. This deconstruction could be construed as dehumanizing the body or a distinct focus on female pleasure and gratification. </p>
<p>Unlike pornography this image removes all other elements a porn video or image would include the female protagonist, as discussed in section two mass media pornography has a very limited set of portrayals of female sexuality. Female pleasure is insinuated in pornography a result of male stimulation or for the male gaze. </p>
<p>This painting contradicts this misconception it is detached from the stereotypical identity society has become familiarised with. The painting bears similarities with Gustav Courbet’s l’Origin du monde. </p>
<p>This image is notorious for it explicitness and caused a lot of controversy of its displaying in art galleries. The image also lacks a female identity and personally I don’t think it’s as visceral as minters image. The difference between the two is gaze minter’s image suggests masturbation and female arousal. </p>
<p>Courbet’s image is positioned static created to be looked at with arousal and admiration. Arguably Minters image would have originated from a similar precedent pornography, but her interpretation and subversion are a means of challenging this trait. Her painting contains marks and bleed’s she stated she was literally beating up her paintings as a process of frustration when attempting to exude her pro sex feminism and it received backlash, it was a process of frustration.  </p>
