<h1>Gender Sexuality and Feminism </h1>
<h2>Bojan Maric</h2>
<p>May 04, 2014</p>
<p>Gender has always been one of the strongest aspects of the human notion of identity. From the old pre-Judeo-Christian ideas of binary gender, of two genders determined by sex which, for one reason or another, are in constant opposition and conflict, to the more contemporary definitions that break the concept into an entire spectrum of identities– it has always been something people strongly felt about.</p>
<p>. As such, it has also been an ideal vehicle for a multitude of artists to engage in discussions with the audience via their works. More often than not, how culture is perceived, and how it is created, is based on gender, on the way the artist sees him or herself and feels the world around them and on the way the audience reacts to what they’re presented with – each through the lense of their own set of expectations.[5]</p>
<p>Having, in a way, been treated as second-rate citizens in many societies, women have only fairly recently (about a century or so ago) won their rightful place in the art world and given a voice.</p>
<p>Coinciding with, and mostly being a product of the rise of feminism, this has given the movement a powerful outlet for action as well as creativity.[6] Thus, the art world has given us plenty of empowered, determined, and immensely creative women who are considered cultural as well as feminist iconsof today. </p>
<p>A biographical film on Frida Kahlohas made her fascinating body of work known to the masses, while Marina Abramovicbecame a household name even outside of the art circles after a performance piece inspired by her work appeared on the globally popular TV show Sex and the City. Such cross-pollination of “high” and popular culture created a full circle, encompassing entertainment, philosophy, the arts, social activism, politics and beyond.</p>
<p>Sexuality has always been no less of a hot topic than gender. </p>

<p>Depending on the cultural, religious, and moral climate, it was more or less an an allegory in art.</p>
<p>For centuries thinly veiled in mythological and allegorical subjects, the depiction of sexual themes became more and more bold, until Toulouse-Lautrec and later Egon Schiele started really taking down the barriers with un-idealized depictions of real-life situations of the more intimate kind. </p>
<p>Further down the line, the roaring 1920’s and the hippie movement of the 1960’s brought with them two waves of liberation, the latter of which is often touted “the sexual revolution”.</p>
<p>Fashion, with its idea of the modern, free-thinking flapper, and later science, with the invention of the birth-control pill, both contributed to sex and sexuality being viewed as something to be celebrated, rather than to be ashamed of.</p>
<p>Throughout the second half of the 20th century, in the entertainment world, stars such as Madonna did their share of the work in deconstructing old, patriarchal notions of modesty.</p>
<p>The arts may have been leading the way but it was popular (or rather mass culture) that really tore down most of the barriers. And while today some more radical creative minds still explore sexuality in a very raw manner, the theme seems to have lost some of its appeal due to its omnipresence in the media.</p>
</div>

<div class="multicol">
<p>LGBT topics, still a somewhat controversial topic across the globe, are possibly among the most discussed issues of our generation. Both popular culture as well as the more avant-garde sections of the arts mimic this in sync. Of course, homoerotic themes have been around for centuries, albeit under a deep cover of prejudice. </p>
<p>Even though some pieces from the late Victorian era would nowadays be considered gay-themed (the canvases of Henry Scott Tuke immediately spring to mind), it was only in the late 60s and early 70s, hand in hand with the abovementioned sexual revolution, that the grip began to loosen and themes dealing with different kinds of love and sexuality could be treated publically.[7]Lesbian art and its subject-matter began to appear in works of artists with a feminist stance and unabashed gay erotica (and sometimes pornography) was the core of the underground work of Tom of Finland. </p>
<p>Some of the biggest names of 20th century art were, in fact, gay icons – Andy Warhol, Francis Bacon, performance artist and Lucian Freud‘s muse Leigh Bowery, legendary portrait photographer Annie Leibovitz etc. Music icons such as David Bowie, Janis Joplin, Michael Jackson, Annie Lennox and many more explored androgyny and ambiguous sexuality both in their public personas and their performance.</p>
<p>More recently, in the 21st century, themes dealing with the new ways of looking at and expressing gender (along with the increased visibility of transgender individuals) are as present in galleries as they are in the tabloid press.</p>
<p>On a more grim note, the HIV pandemic has been an ill-looking shadow to the otherwise positive and progressive aspects of the sexual revolution. It created a mass hysteria in the media and spread fear among the general population. </p>
<p>Along with thousands of other lives, the disease took such avant-garde performers as Klaus Nomi and Leigh Bowery, as well as one of the biggest rock stars in the world, Freddie Mercury. It is no wonder then that the outbreak of HIV and its consequences made a shockwave through the art world, inspiring many artists to create new, moving, insightful, often warning images.</p>
<p> Nicholas Nixon‘s portrait photographs of AIDS victims in the 1980’s captured with extreme realism the physical deterioration of the human body, making them a particularly poignant form of decay art.[8] All this has, in a way, given sexual freedom a somewhat tarnished look, yet, as science continues to develop, we can only hope that HIV, along with many other diseases, will become a thing of the past. Whatever we were taught to believe, we now can see that our reality as a whole is a developing one, in a constant state of flux, and that some issues need to be readdressed over and over again – in politics, in the media, and the arts – before they are truly dealt with. The renewed need to stand up to racial prejudice and explore the causes of it is an obvious example of such unfinished business.</p>
